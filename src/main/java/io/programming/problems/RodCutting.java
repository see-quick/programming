/**
 * One of the technique of Dynamic Programming.
 *
 * The <b>rod-cutting problem</b> is the following. Given a rod of length n inches and a table of prices pi for i D 1; 2; : : : ; n,
 * determine the maximum revenue rn obtain- able by cutting up the rod and selling the pieces. Note that if the price pn
 * for a rod of length n is large enough, an optimal solution may require no cutting at all.
 * Consider the case when n D 4. Figure 15.2 shows all the ways to cut up a rod of 4 inches in length,
 * including the way with no cuts at all. We see that cutting a 4-inch rod into two 2-inch pieces produces revenue
 * p2 C p2 D 5 C 5 D 10, which is optimal.
 *
 * Note: Variation of the Unbounded Knapsack problem (you can make a reduction and translate this problem...)
